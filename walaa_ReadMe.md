
This repository contain 4 files as follows:

1- UKF_with_kappa_equal4_with_figure.py

2- Unscented kalman filter with different kappas v9.ipynb
3- pendulum_simulation_without_figures.py

4- pendulumsimulation gui.ipynb


These files has the same simulation with slightly changes.

The first one show one figure before and after implementing UKF 

The second one show different figures by changing the parameters of sigma point.

The third one just the simulation.

The last one I added some basic widget, to let you know which button will end the simulation

The second part of portofolio contains what I have done in this notebook.
Adding all the helpful references that help me to understand UKF.
